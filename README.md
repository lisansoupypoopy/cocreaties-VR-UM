This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## This website is made as a project for the University of Maastricht.

We held co-creation sessions with various students, to explore the possibilities of VR in education. This website is a collection of the students' ideas.
