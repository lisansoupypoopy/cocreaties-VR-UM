            Luca and a friend were waiting in the Randwijck canteen, where they had 2 hours to kill before their lecture. 
            We had cookies, stroopwafels and an opportunity for distraction.

    conclusion: "What if students could actually rehearse complex lab procedures whenever and wherever they want? That’s where virtual rehearsal comes in. Instead of just watching or reading about flow cytometry, they could actually try it, without the expensive equipment or crowded labs. By creating a VR experience where students can explore, repeat, and interact with biomedical experiments, we open the door to contextualized learning. It’s no longer just theory, it’s something they can step into. With focused immersion, distractions fade away, and understanding clicks faster. We wanted to give them extraordinary abilities: zoom into cells, walk through molecular processes, or replay that one tricky step until it makes sense. And because it’s all in VR, students can experience this remote presence from home, the library, or wherever they feel most focused.",

The mentor could see the environment as well, and go in on their own accord too or plan sessions with the student.",

    conclusion: "What if students could reflect on their progress and connect with mentors whenever and wherever they feel most at ease? Instead of rushed meetings squeezed between busy schedules, students can step into a calm, personalized VR space one that invites focus, reflection, and meaningful connection. By creating a VR experience where students can set learning goals, track their progress, and meet with mentors in an environment they choose, we open the door to active autonomy. They decide when to check in, where they want to be, and how they want to work. In this immersive space, distractions fade, and motivation has room to grow. Somewhere they can write in a virtual journal, revisit their goals, or reflect without judgment. And because it’s all in VR, mentors can join too whether in a planned session or spontaneously sharing the same virtual setting. This shared remote presence helps build connection, even from a distance.",
