            Luca and a friend were waiting in the Randwijck canteen, where they had 2 hours to kill before their lecture. 
            We had cookies, stroopwafels and an opportunity for distraction.

    },
    conclusion: "What if students could actually rehearse complex lab procedures whenever and wherever they want? That’s where virtual rehearsal comes in. Instead of just watching or reading about flow cytometry, they could actually try it, without the expensive equipment or crowded labs. By creating a VR experience where students can explore, repeat, and interact with biomedical experiments, we open the door to contextualized learning. It’s no longer just theory, it’s something they can step into. With focused immersion, distractions fade away, and understanding clicks faster. We wanted to give them extraordinary abilities: zoom into cells, walk through molecular processes, or replay that one tricky step until it makes sense. And because it’s all in VR, students can experience this remote presence from home, the library, or wherever they feel most focused.",
